      <section>
        <h2>Core Concept</h2>
        <p>RuneWars brings classic turn-based RPG combat to life with a focus on team strategy and resource management. Players command a roster of unique characters, each with distinct roles and abilities, to outmaneuver their opponents. The shared "skill point" pool adds a layer of depth, forcing teams to make critical decisions on when and how to unleash their most devastating attacks or life-saving heals.</p>

        <h2>Combat System</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Turn-Based System:</strong> 🔄 Characters act in sequence, determined by their <span class="highlight">speed</span> stat.</li>
          <li><strong>Two Teams:</strong> 🤝 Players are divided into two opposing teams.</li>
          <li>
            <h3>Skill Points: 🌟 A Shared Team Resource</h3>
            <p>Skill points are essential for activating powerful special skills. They are a common resource shared by all characters on a team.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Basic Attack:</strong> 🗡️ A standard attack dealing damage scaled by character stats. Successfully using a basic attack earns the team <span class="highlight">one skill point</span>.</li>
              <li><strong>Skill:</strong> ✨ A unique ability specific to each character, with varying effects. Utilizing a skill <span class="highlight">consumes skill points</span> from the team's shared pool.</li>
              <li><strong>Skill Point Cap:</strong> The team's skill point pool is capped at <span class="highlight">5 points</span>.</li>
              <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> 🧠 Teams must strategically manage skill points as they are shared amongst all characters.</li>
              <li><strong>Important Note:</strong> ⚠️ If characters use skill points and the pool becomes 0, then the next character taking a turn <span class="highlight">cannot use their skill</span>. They will be bound to use a basic attack in order to gain one skill point for the team.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Character System</h2>
        <p>Each character possesses the following core attributes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Health:</strong> ❤️ & <strong>Max Health:</strong> 💖 - Your character's current and maximum life points.</li>
          <li><strong>Attack:</strong> 💥 - Determines the damage dealt by basic attacks and some skills.</li>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 🏃💨 - Dictates the turn order in combat; higher speed means earlier turns.</li>
          <li><strong>Defense:</strong> 🛡️ - Reduces incoming damage from enemy attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>List of Buffs and Debuffs:</strong> ⬆️ ⬇️ - Temporary effects that enhance (buffs) or hinder (debuffs) character stats or abilities.</li>
        </ul>
